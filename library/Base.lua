---# Base
---These are a loose collection of functions which can be used to perform a variety of actions within Tabletop Simulator.
---
---These functions can utilize in-game Objects, but none of them can be enacted on in-game `Objects`. They all deal with the game space.

---## Global Functions
---General functions which work within any script.

---Adds a menu item to the Global right-click context menu. Global menu is shown when player right-clicks on empty space or table.
---@param label string Label for the menu item.
---@param toRunFunc fun(player_color: PlayerColor, menu_position: VectorLike) Execute if menu item is selected.<ul>`player_color` — [Player Color](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/player/colors/) who selected the menu item.<br>`menu_position` — Global position of the right-click context menu.</ul>
---@param keep_open? bool Whether to keep the Context Menu open after menu item was selected. *Optional, Default: keep_open = false*
---@param require_table? bool Show Added menu item when right-clicked on empty space or table. *Optional, Default: require_table = false*
---
---***
---
---### Example Usage
---```
---function onLoad()
---    addContextMenuItem("doStuff", itemAction)
---end
---
---function itemAction(player_color, menu_position)
---    print(player_color)
---end
---```

---Clear all menu items added by [addContextMenuItem(...)](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/base/#addcontextmenuitem).
---@return bool
function clearContextMenu() end

---Copy a list of Objects to the clipboard. Works with [paste(...)](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/base/#paste).
---
---This is similar to highlighting the objects in-game and copying them.
---
---@param object_list Object[] A Table of in-game objects to be copied.
---@return bool
---
---***
---### Example Usage

---# Hotkey Functions

---The definition for a hotkey callback function, with annotations on the parameters.
---@private
---@param playerColor PlayerColor Player Color of the player that pressed the hotkey.
---@param hoveredObject Object The object that the Player's pointer was hovering over at the moment the key was pressed/released. `nil` if no object was under the Player's pointer at the time
---@param pointerPosition VectorLike World Position of the Player's pointer at the moment the key was pressed/released.
---@param isKeyUp bool Whether this callback is being triggered in response to a hotkey being released.
function addHotkeyCallback(playerColor, hoveredObject, pointerPosition, isKeyUp) end

---Add a bindable hotkey to the game.
---
--->### 🔥 Important
--->Added hotkeys are unable to persist between loads/rewinds, because the bound callback function may no longer exist.
--->Therefore this function needs to be called each time the game is loaded. As long as the same labels are used,
--->then player hotkey bindings will persist.
---@param label string
---@param toRunFunc fun(playerColor: PlayerColor, hoveredObject: Object, pointerPosition: Vector, isKeyUp: bool) The function that will be executed whenever the hotkey is pressed, and also when released if triggerOnKeyUp is true.
---@param trigger_on_key_up bool Whether the callback is also executed when the hotkey is released. The callback is always triggered when the hotkey is pressed. *Optional, defaults to false.*
---
---***
---
--->### ⚠️ Warning
--->Hotkey bindings do not prevent the behavior of Settings key bindings i.e. if "R" (shuffle by default) is assigned as
---a hotkey, the hotkey callback and the default shuffle behavior will both be executed whenever R is pressed.
---
---### Example Usage
---```
---function onLoad()
---    addHotkey("My Hotkey", function(playerColor, object, pointerPosition, isKeyUp)
---        local action = isKeyUp and "released" or "pressed"

--->### ✏️ Notes
--->If `value` is not already a `string`, then it will be converted to a human\-readable representation.
--->
--->If `value` is a `table`, then the table's contents (keys & values) will be displayed. The contents of nested tables
