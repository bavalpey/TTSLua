--- An in-game physical Object. Sometimes Global.
---
---The Object class represents any entity within tabletop simulator. Once you have a reference to an object in your script you can call functions on it directly. Example: ``obj.getPosition(...)``. You can get a reference to an object multiple ways;
---- Using the self property if your script is on an Object and referring to that Object.
---- Using [``getObjectFromGUID(...)``](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/base/#getobjectfromguid) with the object's GUID (found by right clicking it with the pointer).
---- Getting it as a return from another function, like with [``spawnObject(...)``](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/base/#spawnObject).

---# UI Function Details
---There are two UI systems for Tabletop Simulator. The first is the Classic UI system that integrates nicely and has

---The second system, dubbed "Custom UI" utilizes an XML UI Framework based roughly off of
---[XMLLayout](https://www.digital-legacy.co.za/XmlLayout/Documentation/).
---The Custom UI system allows for far greater control over the UI elements, but has some limitations and is not as

--->### Putting Cards into Decks
--->When you call this `putObject()` to put a card into a deck, the card goes into the end of the deck which is closest

---
--->### Caution
---Certain containers only exist whilst they have more than one object contained within them (e.g. decks). Once you
---remove the second last object from a container, the container will be destroyed and the remaining contained object
---will spawn in its place. After calling takeObject(...) you can check for a
---[remainder](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#remainder).
---
--->### Example
--->Take an object out of a container. As we take it out we'll instruct the object to smooth move (default positioning
--->behavior) to coordinates (0, 5, 0). Additionally, we're going to add a blue highlight on the object we've taken out.
--->```
---local takenObject = container.takeObject({
---    position = {x = 0, y = 5, z = 0},
---})
---takenObject.highlightOn('Blue')
--->```
---
--->### Advanced example
--->Take an object out of a container, and then apply an upward force (impulse) shooting it into the air. We can only
--->[apply an impulse](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#addforce) to an object once its (underlying rigid body)
--->has finished spawning. Additionally, freshly spawned objects are frozen in place for a single frame. So we need to
--->wait for the taken object to finish spawning (i.e. `callback function`) *then*
--->[wait one more frame](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/wait/#frames) before applying the impulse.
--->```
---container.takeObject({
---    callback_function = function(spawnedObject)
---        Wait.frames(function()
---            -- We've just waited a frame, which has given the object time to unfreeze.
---            -- However, it's also given the object time to enter another container, if
---            -- it spawned on one. Thus, we must confirm the object is not destroyed.
---            if not spawnedObject.isDestroyed() then
---                spawnedObject.addForce({0, 30, 0})
---            end
---        end)
---    end,
---    smooth = false, -- Smooth moving objects cannot have forces applied to them.

---```
-----Give an object 3 snap points. A regular snap point, a rotation snap point, and a rotation snap point with a tag.
---object.setSnapPoints({
---    {
---        position = {5, 2, 5}
---    },
---    {
---        position = {5, 2, 5},

---    {
---        position = {-3, 2, 0},
